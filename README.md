# university-data-processing-application

## Introduction
This project is designed to manage various data related to a university's departments, employees, and students, including their counseling and performance data. The system allows for efficient retrieval, processing, and statistical analysis of this data. Built using object-oriented programming principles, the application incorporates key design patterns to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

## Research Objectives
1. Develop a system to manage and process university data, including departments, employees, students, and performance metrics.
2. Implement object-oriented design principles using UML diagrams to plan the system architecture.
3. Apply various design patterns (Creational, Structural, Behavioral) to enhance system functionality.
4. Build a robust system capable of performing complex data retrieval and statistical operations.
5. Evaluate how design patterns improve code efficiency, maintainability, and scalability.

## System Features
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch detailed information about departments, employees, and students based on unique IDs.
- **Counseling Information**: Retrieve student counseling data and department assignments.
- **Performance Analysis**: Perform statistical operations like sum, average, min, and max on student performance data.
- **Departmental Statistics**: Retrieve department-specific data, including the number of employees and students.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns to optimize the system.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **UML Tools**: For designing class diagrams and architectural layouts.
- **Libraries**: Java libraries for handling file I/O and data processing.
- **Design Patterns**: Builder, Adapter, and Strategy patterns for enhancing system functionality and flexibility.

## Conclusion
The University Data Processing Application demonstrates the effective use of object-oriented programming and design patterns in creating a scalable and maintainable system. By incorporating UML design and applying multiple design patterns, the system ensures flexibility in managing university data and performing complex operations like statistical analysis and data retrieval. The application showcases how design patterns significantly improve software design, making it easier to extend and maintain.
